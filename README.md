# What is it?
It's a project for fun. Program uses my own encryption/decryption system which will be used in future projects but this is just a showcase.

# Usage
## Running script
You can run a program directly from **main.py** in the source folder or **distro50.bat** in binaries.
You can also add batch file to your PATH environment variable and use distro50 command directly from a terminal.
